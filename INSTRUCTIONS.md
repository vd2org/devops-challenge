# Welcome to the DevOps challenge

### Prerequisites

* A GitHub account
* A [TravisCI](https://docs.travis-ci.com) account
* A [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com) account
* Local Docker installation


### Instructions

**Your `codeName = thedoctor`** - Use it throughout the task.
We've found a data leak in our company, but before we're deleting our resources, we need you to extract the information and deliver it.
You're assigned with the creation of a device that will be used as a POC to transfer highly sensitive data.
With the language of your choice follow these instructions in the next 72 hours to stop the leak:

1. Clone this project, change its name and restructure it as you see fit, create your own GitHub repo with the code
2. Write an application that will extract the secret string from a DynamoDB table in our account
3. The `secret_code` lies in a DynamoDB table `devops-challenge` where `code_name = #{codeName}`
4. The keys that will provide access to the account have been provided separatly, **DO NOT COMMIT THEM**, if the keys are exposed to GitHub, we will be notified and you will be disqualified
5. Create a docker container that will publish `secret_code` to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/secret`
6. Create a [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) account, and add a `.travis.yml` that will build, test and deploy your code and container/s
7. The Travis process should `publish` the contianer to your own docker hub account
8. A link to the container on docker hub should be published as `container` to `/health` (See requirement #2)
9. A link to the GitHub project should be published as `project` to `/health` (See requirement #2)
10. Once completed, reply to the challenge email:
```
Subject: DevOps Challenge complete
Content: Name:      <YOUR_NAME>
         Project:   <LINK TO GITHUB PROJECT>
Attached: `.env` (if you used one)

```

#### Bonus - This is not a must
> To wrap up the project, prepare a `environment.template` file, that would contain a CloudFormation YAML.
> The template should create an environment ready to deploy your application to AWS.
> You may choose any AWS service you see fit for the deployment.
> When using the template in CloudFormation, the user should be able to fill in parameters required (e.g `vpc-id`, `instance-type` etc).

### The result should

1. Return `{ secret_code: <CODE> }` to http://127.0.0.1:5000/secret
2. Return `{ status: healthy, container: <LINK_TO_HUB>, project: github.com/omerxx/ecscale }` to http://127.0.0.1:5000/health
3. Running `docker-compose up` should get everything up and running
4. Contain a minimal test suit
5. Be tested and built in Travis on push to `master` branch
6. Contain a well documented code, and a `SUMMARY.md` file explaining each step of the development process
7. Contain a `TROUBLE.md` describing difficulties along the way and their solutions
8. Contain a `INSTRCUTIONS.md` explaining a cloning user how to use the repo - running, testing etc.
9. Be published as a GitHub project under your account e.g `github.com/<GitHub_User>/<Challange_Project>`
10. `verification.sh` should run instantly, if you used a `.env` file, share it privately in the returning email


### Guidance (These are only for general assitance and are not a must):

1. Use informative commit messages
2. Think *security*: Avoid exposing secrets in any way (Tip: use `.env` file for the `compose`ing, and `.gitignore` it. Be sure to provide the file upon completing the task.
3. Different routers in [Ruby](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra), [Python](http://flask.pocoo.org/), [Go](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/) and [Node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)
4. Structure the project in a maintainable logic way, you may use `/example`
5. Use the `example/screenshots/` for a general idea of the outcome
